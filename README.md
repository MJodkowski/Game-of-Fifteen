# GAME OF FIFTEEN
Created using Create-React-App with CSS Modules.

## Overview

I wrote the first iteration of this project in C as part of Harvard's CS50 course. After learning the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and JS, I rewrote most of the code and added a basic GUI (the C version was text-only). Later, having taken a course in React, I decided to apply what I had learned and this is the end result. 

## To Do

I am still working on ironing out some kinks related to how the game works on mobile devices.
